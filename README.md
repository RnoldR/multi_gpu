# multi_gpu
Testing the impact of multiple GPU's on my Keras RNN models. File rnn_demo.py contains the most simplified model I could think of now. I added some small data file in order to test it. File rnn_demo_plot.py plots the effect of single and and multi GPU runs. The results of one succesful run (ok.csv) are included. I got quite some issues with running multi GPU models. They are described below

## Issues with multi GPU
